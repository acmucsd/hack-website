# ACM Hack Website

**Check it out @ [hack.acmucsd.com](https://hack.acmucsd.com)!**

Welcome to ACM Hack's main website! This website serves as an introduction to the Hack community, and provides information about our upcoming events and resources. It's also the primary host of our Hack School curriculum, which is a series of workshops designed to teach students the fundamentals of full-stack development and software engineering.

The content on this website is accessible to anyone, regardless of acceptance to Hack School. Feel free to use this for ACM Projects, personal projects, or just to learn something new!

This project was bootstrapped with [Nextra](https://nextra.site) and deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

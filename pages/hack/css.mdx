# Week 1 CSS

## What is CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a fundamental web technology used to control the presentation 
and layout of HTML documents. It provides a powerful set of rules and properties that allow 
developers to customize the appearance of HTML elements, making it an essential tool for building 
visually appealing and responsive web applications.

## Applying CSS to HTML components

CSS can be applied to HTML components in various ways. Here are some common methods:

### Inline CSS

Inline CSS involves adding styles directly to an HTML element using the "style" attribute. 
This method is handy for making quick style changes to specific elements, but it's generally 
not recommended for extensive styling due to its lack of separation between content and presentation.

```html copy showLineNumbers
<h2 style="color: red; text-align: center;">Come to Hack School next week!</h2>
```

### Internal CSS

Internal CSS is placed within the `<style>` tags in the `<head>` section of the HTML document. 
It allows you to define CSS rules that apply only to the specific HTML document.

```html copy showLineNumbers
<head>
  <style>
    h2 {
      color: red;
      text-align: center;
    }
  </style>
</head>

<h2>Come to Hack School next week!</h2>
```

### External CSS

External CSS involves creating a separate CSS file with all the styles and linking it 
to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag. This method promotes better code organization 
and maintainability, as you can reuse the same stylesheet across multiple HTML files.

styles.css:
```css copy showLineNumbers
h2 {
    color: red;
    text-align: center;
}
```

index.html:
```html copy showLineNumbers
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>

<h2>Come to Hack School next week!</h2>
```

### Selectors

* Universal Selector: Selects all HTML elements. The universal selector is represented by an asterisk `*`.
* Element Selector: Selects HTML elements by their tag name. For example, the p selector targets all `<div>` elements.

styles.css:
```css copy showLineNumbers
div {
    padding: 32px;
}
```

index.html:
```html copy showLineNumbers
<div>
    <p> The padding of this div is 32 px!</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3> The padding of this div is also 32 px!</p>
</div>
```

* Class Selector: Selects HTML elements by their class attribute. Class selectors start with a dot `.`, 
followed by the class name. For example, the .important selector targets all elements with the class "important."
* ID Selector: Selects a single HTML element by its ID attribute. ID selectors start with a hash `#`, 
followed by the ID name. For example, the #special selector targets the element with the ID "special."

styles.css:
```css copy showLineNumbers
#navbar {
    background-color: black;
    font-size: 16px;
}

.blue {
    color: blue;
}
```

index.html:
```html copy showLineNumbers
<div id="navbar">
    <ul>
        <li class="blue"><a href="home.asp">Blue Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="contact.asp">Contact</a></li>
        <li class="blue"><a href="about.asp">Blue About</a></li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

## Common properties that CSS can modify 

- **Color**: `color` - Changing the text color, background color, or border color of elements.
- **Font**: `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `font-style`, etc. - Modifying the font family, size, weight, style, and other typography-related properties.
- **Margins**: `margin` - Adjusting the space around an element, controlling the gap between elements.
- **Padding**: `padding` - Adding space inside an element's boundaries, creating space between content and borders.
- **Borders**: `border`, `border-width`, `border-style`, `border-color` - Styling borders around elements, controlling their width, style (solid, dashed, dotted, etc.), and color.
- **Width and Height**: `width`, `height` - Specifying the dimensions of an element, allowing control over its size.
- **Background**: `background-image`, `background-color`, `background-position`, etc. - Setting background images, colors, and positioning for elements.
- **Text**: `text-align`, `text-decoration`, `text-transform` - Controlling text alignment, text decoration (underline, overline, etc.), and text transformation (uppercase, lowercase, capitalize).
- **Display**: `display` - Changing how elements are displayed (block, inline, flex, grid, etc.) and how they interact with other elements.
- **Positioning**: `position`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` - Controlling the positioning of elements on the page using properties like position, top, bottom, left, right, etc.
- **Float**: `float` - Floating elements to either the left or right side of their container.
- **Opacity**: `opacity` - Adjusting the transparency of elements and their content.
- **Transitions and Animations**: `transition`, `animation` - Applying smooth transitions and animations to elements.
- **Shadows**: `box-shadow`, `text-shadow` - Adding box shadows or text shadows to elements for visual effects.
- **List Styles**: `list-style-type`, `list-style-image`, `list-style-position` - Customizing the appearance of lists (unordered and ordered) with various list-style-type properties.
- **Flexbox and Grid**: `display: flex`, `display: grid`, etc. - Utilizing CSS layout systems like Flexbox and Grid to create responsive and flexible layouts.


## Flexbox Layout

### Introduction to Flexbox

CSS Flexbox is a powerful layout system used to create flexible and responsive web designs. 
It provides an intuitive way to arrange elements within a container and control their alignment, 
distribution, and order.

### Flex Container and Flex Items

A Flex Container is an element to which you apply the CSS property 
`display: flex;` or `display: inline-flex;`. This makes it a container 
for Flex Items, which are the child elements within the Flex Container. 
Flex Items are flexibly arranged inside the container.

import Image from 'next/image'

<Image src="/flex.png" alt="image that explains flex container vs items" width={500} height={500} />

### Main Axis and Cross Axis

Flexbox operates along two axes: the "Main Axis" and the "Cross Axis." 
The Main Axis represents the primary direction of Flex Items' alignment, 
and the Cross Axis is perpendicular to it.

### Flex Container Properties

#### 1. `flex-direction`

The `flex-direction` property determines the direction of the Main Axis. It has four possible values:
- `row`: Flex Items are placed horizontally in a row from left to right (default).
- `row-reverse`: Flex Items are placed horizontally in a reversed order from right to left.
- `column`: Flex Items are placed vertically in a column from top to bottom.
- `column-reverse`: Flex Items are placed vertically in a reversed order from bottom to top.

#### 2. `justify-content`

The `justify-content` property aligns Flex Items along the Main Axis. 
It offers various values to control the spacing between Flex Items:
- `flex-start`: Items are aligned to the start of the container (default).
- `flex-end`: Items are aligned to the end of the container.
- `center`: Items are centered within the container.
- `space-between`: Items are evenly distributed with the first item at the start and the last item at the end.
- `space-around`: Items are evenly distributed with equal space around them.
- `space-evenly`: Items are evenly distributed with equal space around and at the start and end.

#### 3. `align-items`

The `align-items` property aligns Flex Items along the Cross Axis. It has the following values:
- `flex-start`: Items are aligned to the start of the container.
- `flex-end`: Items are aligned to the end of the container.
- `center`: Items are centered along the Cross Axis.
- `baseline`: Items are aligned based on their text baselines.
- `stretch`: Items are stretched to fill the container along the Cross Axis (default).

#### 4. `flex-wrap`

The `flex-wrap` property determines whether Flex Items should wrap to a new line when 
they exceed the Flex Container's width. It has three possible values:
- `nowrap`: Items are displayed in a single line (default).
- `wrap`: Items wrap to a new line as necessary.
- `wrap-reverse`: Items wrap to a new line in reverse order.

#### 5. Quick speed hack

The `flex-flow` property is a shorthand property for setting both the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties.

```css copy showLineNumbers
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row wrap;
}
```

### Flex Item Properties

#### 1. `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`

These properties are collectively known as the "flex shorthand." They control the growth, shrinking, and initial size of Flex Items.
- `flex-grow`: Determines how much an item should grow relative to other items when extra space is available.
- `flex-shrink`: Determines how much an item should shrink relative to other items when there is not enough space.
- `flex-basis`: Specifies the initial size of an item before any available space is distributed.

#### 2. `order`

The `order` property allows you to change the order in which Flex Items appear within the 
Flex Container without changing their source order in the HTML.

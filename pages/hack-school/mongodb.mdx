# Week 2: Databases and MongoDB

## What is a Database?
A database is an organized collection of data or information. It allows people to store information between sessions on a website.
Data in a database is organized in a way to make it easy to write, manage, and update the data.

## SQL
![sql](pages/hack-school/images/sql.png)

One type of database is a SQL (**S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage) database. SQL is a programming language to store and process information
in a relational database. A relational database uses tables to store information, using rows and columns. It looks similar to popular spreadsheet programs
like Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel. Popular database management platforms that uses SQL are PostgreSQL and MySQL.

**Some popular SQL commands include:** 
| Command    | Use |
| -------- | ------- |
| SELECT  | extracts data from database    |
| UPDATE | updates data in database     |
| DELETE    | deletes data from database    |
| INSERT INTO   | inserts data into database    |
| CREATE DATABASE   | creates new database    |
| CREATE TABLE   | creates new table   |


## NoSQL
``` js copy
// Example of a document with user information
{
     "_id": 1,
     "first_name": "Angela",
     "college": "Marshall",
     "year": "2nd year",
     "likes": [
        "food",
        "kpop",
        "ACM"
     ]
}
```
The main type of database that this chapter focuses on is a NoSQL (non-SQL) database. Instead of storing data in
a tabular format, NoSQL databases usually order data using **documents**. Documents store data in key-value pairs.
The values can be strings, numbers, arrays, or objects while the keys are unique identifiers (usually strings) for the values.
These documents are typically stored as JSON, BSON, or XML files. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a text-based format
for structured data which is based on JavaScript object syntax. Some other kinds of NoSQL databases are key value, wide column, vector, and graph
databases.

## [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
MongoDB is a free and open-source NoSQL database management program with data in collections of documents. 
It uses BSON which is a binary encoded JSON-like documents. However, it runs locally on the user's device
which means that the user has to set up, manage, and deploy the database. 

## MongoDB Atlas
MongdoDB Atlas is a cloud database service that deploys and manages a database for you.

### Creating MongoDB Atlas Database
1. Create an account on [MongoDB](https://account.mongodb.com/account/login)
2. Once logged in, navigate to the **Database Deployments** page and click on the **Build a Database** button 
3. Choose the M0 (free) option and customize name for the cluster
4. Authenticate the connection with a username and password and add your IP address to whitelist it
5. Connect to the database with the Node.js driver and copy the connection string

### Creating an Environment Variables File
To protect sensitive information such as passwords and API credentials, it's good to create a .env file
which configures your information into variables that can be used in the code. This hides your information
from the public when you push your code to a platform like Github.
1. Use npm to install the dotenv library
```bash copy showLineNumbers
npm install dotenv
```
2. In your code environment, create a new file and name it *.env*
3. Add any secret information into variables
```js copy showLineNumbers
KEY=1593ad25grb98324
PASSWORD=123456789a
```
4. Create a folder named *config* and add a JavaScript file with following code snippet
```js copy showLineNumbers
require('dotenv').config()

const config = {
    key: process.env.KEY,
    password: process.env.PASSWORD
}

module.exports = config;
```
5. To use a variable from your .env file, you can access it from the config object
```js copy showLineNumbers
// 1593ad25grb98324
config.key
// 123456789a
config.password
```
6. In your .gitignore file, make sure to add your .env file so it isn't pushed to your Github repo!

### Connecting to MongoDB Atlas Database
1. After you copy the connection string, add it to an .env file
```js copy showLineNumbers
DATABASE_URL=connectionstringurl
```
2. In a JavaScript file, add the following code snippet
```js copy showLineNumbers
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose.connect(config.databaseUrl, {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true }).then(() => {
  console.log('Connected to MongoDB database');
});
```

## Mongoose
```bash copy showLineNumbers
npm install mongoose
```
Mongoose is a ODM (Object Data Modeling/Object Document Mapping) JavaScript library that wraps MongoDB with a schema-based approach. Schemas are blueprints for
the data. Using these schemas, we can create models which help us create and read documents. Install
the library with npm. 

## Defining Schemas
```js copy showLineNumbers
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new Schema({
  id: {
    type: mongoose.ObjectId,
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: true // Throws error if email is missing
  },
  password: {
    type: String,
    required: true // Throws error if password is missing
  },
  username: {
    type: String,
    required: true, // Throws error if username is missing
    unique: true // Error is thrown for duplicate usernames
  },
  college: {
    type: String
  },
  year: {
    type: Number
  },
  likes: {
    type: [[String]] // Array of strings
  },
  createdAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now // Sets default value as current date
  }
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```
To create a schema, Mongoose uses keys with configuration objects called SchemaTypes. These SchemaTypes dictate
the type, getters/setters, and valid values for that key. 

**Valid SchemaTypes include:**
| Type    | Example |
| -------- | ------- |
| String | "Henry" | 
| Number | 24 | 
| Date | "2023-12-09" |
| Boolean | true |
| ObjectId | "5e1a0651741b255ddda996c4" |
| Array | [2, 4, 6, 8] |

**Common Validators include:**
| Validator | Use |
| -------- | ------- |
| min | Specifies minimum values for numbers and dates |
| max | Specifies maximum values for numbers and dates |
| minlength | Specifies minimum length for strings | 
| maxlength | Specifies maximum length for strings | 
| required | Ensures field is not empty or undefined |
| unique | Ensures field value if unique across documents in collection | 
| default | Provides default value if not provided | 
| enum | Restricts field to predefined set of values |
| match | Validates a field against a regex expression |

## CRUD Operations
CRUD (**C**reate **R**ead **U**pdate **D**elete) Operations are four basic operations for any application with a database.

### Create
```js copy showLineNumbers
// Create a new user from the given object
const newUser = {
    "_id": 2,
    "email": "acmhack@gmail.com",
    "password": "strONgestpasswOrdever!",
    "username": "acmlovesyou",
    "college": "Sixth",
    "year": 2027,
    "likes": [
      "HTML/CSS",
      "JavaScript",
      "React"
    ]
};
User.create(newUser);
```
Create operations add a new document to the database. Let's add a new user using the User schema!

### Read
```js copy showLineNumbers
// Find all users
User.find().exec();

// Find a user by id
User.findById(id).exec();

// Find first user whose college is Marshall, else return "null"
User.findOne({ college: 'Marshall' }).exec();
```
Read operations allow us to get data from the database. They can also filter based on queries. The three
most common operations are shown above: find, findById, and findOne. 

### Update
```js copy showLineNumbers
// Update a user with specified username to have a new college 
User.updateOne({username: "acmlovesyou"},
    {$set: {college: "Revelle"}});

// Update all users with Warren as their college to have raccoon in their likes
User.updateMany({college: "Warren"},
    {$push: {likes: "racoon"}});

// Create a new user if one with specified condition doesn't exist
// It should have all required keys from the database
User.updateOne({username: "yay"},
    {$set: {email: "example@gmail.com", password: "yay123", year: 2025}}, {upsert: true});
```
Update operations are similar to create operations, but modify existing documents. As shown above, updateOne modifies
only one user document while updateMany modifies all documents in a collection. 

**Common Update Operations include:**

| Operation | Use |
| -------- | ------- |
| $set | Sets value of one or more field |
| $inc | Increment value of numeric field by specified amount | 
| $push | Add element to an array field |
| $pull | Removes element from an array field |
| $upsert | If true, creates new document when one isn't found |

### Delete
```js copy showLineNumbers
// delete user with username ihatehack in the database
User.deleteOne({username: 'ihatehack'});

// delete all users with Eighth as their college
User.deleteMany({college: 'Eighth'});
```
Delete operations remove documents from the database. As shown above, deleteOne deletes only one user document
while deleteMany deletes all documents with that condition in the collection.

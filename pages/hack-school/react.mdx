# Week 3: React

## What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to to create interactive, complex, and dynamic user interfaces by breaking them down into small, isolated pieces of code called <ins>**components**</ins>. The name "React" is derived from its ability to synchronize changes in the user interface with changes in data reactively. This means that when your data changes, React updates the corresponding parts of the user interface without the need for manual intervention, resulting in a highly responsive and efficient application.

## JSX

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React. It allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files to describe the structure of your UI. JSX provides several added functionalities that make it a powerful tool for building dynamic user interfaces. You can learn more about it [here](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)

* **Curly Braces for Variables:**
    You can use curly braces `{}` in JSX to embed variables and JavaScript expressions directly within your HTML-like code. This allows you to dynamically render content based on variables. For example:

    ```jsx copy showLineNumbers
    const greeting = "Hello, React!";
    const element = <h1>{greeting}</h1>;
    ```

* **Embedding JavaScript Logic:**
    With JSX, you can add JavaScript logic directly to your code. This lets you do things like show or hide elements based on conditions, create lists from arrays, and perform other dynamic operations. For example:

    ```jsx copy showLineNumbers
    const isUserLoggedIn = true;

    const element = (
    <div>
        <h1>Welcome to our website</h1>
        {isUserLoggedIn ? <p>You are logged in.</p> : <p>Please log in.</p>}
    </div>
    );
    ```

* **Class Declaration:**
    You can declare CSS classes in JSX using the `className` attribute instead of the traditional `class` attribute used in HTML. This is because `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript. For example:

    ```jsx copy showLineNumbers
    const element = <div className="container">This has a CSS class.</div>;
    ```

* **Event Handlers:**
    In JSX, you can add event handlers directly to elements by specifying them as attributes. For example, to add a click event handler to a button:


    ```jsx copy showLineNumbers
    function handleClick() {
    alert('Button clicked!');
    }

    const element = <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;
    ```

## Components

In React, components are the fundamental building blocks of user interfaces. They are independant and reusable pieces of the UI and can range from small, simple elements like buttons or input fields to entire complex sections of a web page. React applications are composed of many components as shown in the picture below:

Each component can hold other components to make more complex structures as show below:

## Class Components

Class components are one of the two primary ways to define React components. Class components is the more traditional way to create components and are defined using ES6 classes and have a special lifecycle. Class components are often referred to as "stateful components" because they are capable of managing and maintaining their own internal state. State is a way to store and manage data that can change over time and affect the component's rendering. Class components can implement logic and state management, making them suitable for complex components that need to handle dynamic data and user interactions.

A class component must extend the `React.Component` class and must have a `render()` method, which returns the component's JSX structure. Look below to see an how the Tweet Component from above would be coded as a class component:

```jsx copy showLineNumbers
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Tweets extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Tweet />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

class Tweet extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Author />
        <Content />
        <Actions />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

class Author extends Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Author Component</div>;
  }
}

class Content extends Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Content Component</div>;
  }
}

class Actions extends Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Actions Component</div>;
  }
}

export default Tweets;
```
 
import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'
 
<Callout type="error" emoji="⚠️">
  React will throw an error if the render function returns more than one component. To avoid this create a wrapper component with all your components nested in it (look at line 16).
</Callout>

## Functional Components

Functional components are a modern and concise way to define components using JavaScript functions that return JSX. They are simpler than class components and are often referred to as stateless functional components because they don't manage their own state. Instead, they rely on props to receive data and render content. These components are well-suited for rendering UI elements based on the input data (props) they receive. When combined with React Hooks (which we will cover below), functional components have the ability to manage state and handle side effects.

Here's an equivalent example of the previous of the Tweet Component but as a functional component:

```jsx copy showLineNumbers
import React from 'react';

function Tweets() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Tweet />
    </div>
  );
}

function Tweet() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Author />
      <Content />
      <Actions />
    </div>
  );
}

function Author() {
  return <div>Author Component</div>;
}

function Content() {
  return <div>Content Component</div>;
}

function Actions() {
  return <div>Actions Component</div>;
}

export default Tweets;
```

## Props

Props (short for properties) allow you to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They are a way to make your components dynamic and reusable by enabling you to customize a component's behavior and appearance by providing it with data from its parent component. 

![components web page](pages/hack-school/images/props-removebg-preview.png)

Consider the tweet example above but where we pass in data through props from the parent component which is `Tweets` to the child component `Tweet`:

```jsx copy showLineNumbers
import React from 'react';

// Parent Component
function Tweets() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Tweet
        author="John Doe"
        content="This is a sample tweet."
        likes={42}
      />
      <Tweet
        author="Jane Smith"
        content="Another tweet example."
        likes={23}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

// Child Component (Tweet) with regular props
function Tweet(props) {
  return (
    <div className="tweet">
      <div className="author">{props.author}</div>
      <div className="content">{props.content}</div>
      <div className="likes">Likes: {props.likes}</div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Tweets;
```

**ES6 Props:**

With ES6 destructuring, you can destructure props directly within the functional component's parameters, making it more concise to access and use props. ES6 also allows for arrow functions further enhancing readability.

The code below behaves exactly like the example above with the same parent component Tweet:
```jsx copy showLineNumbers
// Child Component (Tweet) with ES6 arrow function props
const Tweet = ({ author, content, likes }) => {
  return (
    <div className="tweet">
      <div className="author">{author}</div>
      <div className="content">{content}</div>
      <div className="likes">Likes: {likes}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## React Hooks

React Hooks are functions that enable functional components to manage state and incorporate other React features that were traditionally available only in class components. Hooks provide a more organized and concise way to work with state, side effects, and context in functional components.

Some common React Hooks include `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useMemo`, `useReducer`, and [more](https://react.dev/reference/react). 


## useState

`useState` is a React Hook that allows functional components to manage state. It lets you add state to your functional components, making them capable of handling dynamic data and re-rendering when that data changes.

With the useState Hook, you can:

* **Initialize State:** Create and initialize state variables within your functional component.
* **Access and Update State:** Access the current state value and update it when necessary.
* **Trigger Re-renders:** When the state changes, the component automatically re-renders to reflect the updated data in the user interface.

Here's an example of how to use the useState Hook:

```jsx copy showLineNumbers
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Tweets() {
  // Initialize state for the list of tweets
  const [tweets, setTweets] = useState([
    { id: 1, author: 'John Doe', content: 'This is a sample tweet.', likes: 42 },
    { id: 2, author: 'Jane Smith', content: 'Another tweet example.', likes: 23 },
  ]);

  // Function to add a new tweet
  const addTweet = () => {
    const newTweet = {
      id: tweets.length + 1,
      author: 'New Author',
      content: 'A new tweet!',
      likes: 0,
    };

    setTweets([...tweets, newTweet]);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={addTweet}>Add Tweet</button>
      {tweets.map((tweet) => (
        <Tweet key={tweet.id} tweet={tweet} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

function Tweet({ tweet }) {
  return (
    <div className="tweet">
      <div className="author">{tweet.author}</div>
      <div className="content">{tweet.content}</div>
      <div className="likes">Likes: {tweet.likes}</div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Tweets;
```

In this example:

* We use the `useState` hook to create and initialize a state variable called `tweets`, which is an array of tweet objects.
* The `addTweet` function is used to add a new tweet to the list of tweets. It creates a new tweet object and uses the spread operator to update the state with the new tweet.
* The `Tweets` component renders a button to add a new tweet and maps over the `tweets` array to render each tweet using the `Tweet` component.
* Note that in React you must provide a unique key in this case `tweet.id` to each element in the list. This helps React keep identify and keep track of all elements in the list.
* The `Tweet` component receives a single `tweet` prop and displays the author, content, and likes of each tweet.

## useEffect

The `useEffect` hook is another commonly used hook in React that allows functional components to perform side effects in a declarative way. Side effects can include data fetching, manual DOM manipulations, subscriptions, and more. `useEffect` is designed to handle these side effects and keep your components in sync with the current state of your application.

Basic usage of `useEffect`:

```jsx copy showLineNumbers
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function ExampleComponent() {
  // State initialization
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Effect declaration
  useEffect(() => {
    // Code to run after component renders

    // Return a cleanup function (optional)
    return () => {
      // Code to run before component unmounts (cleanup)
    };
  }, [dependencies]);

  // Rest of the component code
}
```

Here's what each part does:

* The first argument to useEffect is a function that contains the code to run after the component renders. This is where you put your side-effect logic (line 9).

* The second argument to useEffect is an optional array of dependencies (line 15). It specifies values from the component's scope that the effect relies on. When any of these values change, the effect will be re-executed. If you omit the second argument, the effect will run after every render.

* Inside the effect function, you can perform asynchronous tasks, interact with the DOM, or update component state. It's essential to handle asynchronous operations properly to avoid issues like memory leaks.

* If the effect needs cleanup (e.g., canceling subscriptions or removing event listeners), you can return a cleanup function from the effect. This function will be executed before the component unmounts and before the effect runs again. Cleanup functions are essential for resource management and preventing memory leaks.


## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a framework that makes it easier to build websites with React. It helps you create fast and search-engine-friendly web pages. Next.js takes care of many technical details, like how pages are loaded and how to handle website routing (i.e., moving from one page to another). It also allows you to make parts of your website dynamic while keeping it fast. Check this [reference](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) to learn more.

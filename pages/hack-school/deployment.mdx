# Week 6: Deployment

Deployment is the process of publishing your code on a server so that it becomes accessible over the internet. If you develop a project, your computer can act as a server, but all user interaction might be locally limited. Production-level applications are all deployed on servers, enabling multiple
users to access and interact with them.

## How do servers (briefly) work?

Recalling back to our discussion on clients and servers in week 4, clients send requests to servers for data, and servers process these requests and send back data in the form of a response.
Formally, a server is a specialized computer that can accept requests made by clients across a network.

Servers are linked to a network via IP addresses. IP addresses are unique identifiers (similar to a home address), allowing distinction between servers. This IP address is where data packets are sent (from the client's requests). Learn more about
IP addresses here.

From a client perspective, using IP addresses to access a server is impractical, since IP addresses are long alphanumeric sequences. This is where the Domain Name System (DNS) comes in.
Domain names (such as acmucsd.com or apple.com) are much more human readable, and are mapped to IP addresses through the DNS. When a user enters a domain name into their client, a DNS resolution request is sent to
a DNS resolver to find the corresponding IP address, to access the data in question (in our case, the user interface of apple.com).


## Deploying our front-end with Vercel

Vercel is a popular platform for deploying front-end interfaces and serverless applicationsâ€“particularly those written with Next.js. A alternative option might be Netlify, but this guide will 
demonstrate the use of Vercel.

You can create an account with Vercel (use your GitHub to link all your existing repositories). You should now have the option of importing a project:




Next, you can configure certain settings. For example, if you have both a `client` and `server` directory in your repository, you'll want to change the
Root Directory to point to the one with front-end code. You can also specify any build commands or environment variables at this stage.


If you want to change these settings later on, they can be found under the specific project settings page.

Finally, deploy your project! You should see this interface, where you can view active branches, the status, logs, and more.



## Deploying our back-end

After deploying your front-end, you'll also need to deploy your API. You could run it on your personal computer, but once your app begins to scale, your computer's hardware
may not be adequate enough to handle the incoming load. When you use a service (we'll be using Render), you can generally specify the computing 
capabilities of your server. More powerful configurations will scale up in price.

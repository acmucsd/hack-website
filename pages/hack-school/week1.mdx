# Week 0: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## What is HTML?

Before we start, we would like to mention that this section is indeed long, and contains a lot of information. However, 
we hope that the examples provided help clarify the concepts prevented!

**HTML** or **Hyper Text Markup Language**, is the standard "language" used for creating websites (note: it
is not actually a programming language, it is a markup language). It is the foundation of web
development, and allows you to include text, and media such as images, videos, links, etc to your
website. It is often paired up with CSS and JavaScript to add styles and functionality respectively.
The job of your HTML code is to describe the appearance of your web page.

To achieve this, HTML code comprises of "html elements". These denote the structural semantics for
your text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images and more. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets
(`< >`) and come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The content between the opening and
closing tags defines the element.

## Text formatting and Hyperlinks in HTML

### Fundamentals of HTML Text

Maintaining the structural hierarchy of the content is essential when creating an HTML website.
Different HTML tags tell the browser how to distinguish between various elements such as 
paragraphs and headings.
More interestingly, search engines take into account the headings as keywords, when indexing pages!
In addition, for easily styling content using CSS and/or to add functionality using JavaScript,
 structuring things properly is essential -- this is because your content must 
be wrapped around the correct HTML tag to apply the appropriate property of interest. 

| Code               | Description                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `<h1>` ... `<h6>` | Headings with decreasing levels of importance. |
| `<p>`             | Paragraphs of text.                            |
| `<code>`          | Inline code snippets.                          |
| `<pre>`           | Preformatted text, maintaining whitespace.     |
| `<blockquote>`    | Block-level quotation from another source.     |
| `<cite>`          | Citation of the title of a work.               |
| `<abbr>`          | Abbreviation or acronym with explanation.      |
| `<mark>`          | Highlighted or marked text.                    |
| `<q>`             | Inline quotation.                              |
| `<var>`           | Variable or placeholder text.                  |
| `<kbd>`           | Keyboard input or user action.                 |
| `<samp>`          | Sample output or data.                         |

We reccomened you try these examples on your own!

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
   <h1>Large Heading</h1>
   <h2>Not so large Heading</h2>
   <h3>Smaller Heading</h3>
   <h4> Small Heading</h4>
   <h5> Smaller Heading</h5>
   <h6> Tiny Heading</h6>
   <blockquote> Hi! I am a blockquote.</blockquote>
   <pre>
      I am the pre tag, and I maintain whitespaces! 
      For instance, here is a binary search tree diagram! 

      33
      /    \  
     16        57
   /  \      /   \
  8    21   42    66
   </pre>
   <mark> Look at me! I am highlighted!</mark>
   <p> Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy this code!</p>
```

These will be displayed as:

### Text Formatting

There are various HTML tags that can be used to format text. Here are some of the important ones:

| Code                                       | Description     |
| -------------------------------------------| --------------- |
| `<strong> ... </strong>` or `<b> ... </b>` |Bold Text        |
| `<em>...</em>` or `<i>...</i>`             | Italic Text     |
| `<u>...</u>`                               | Underlined Text |
|`<s> ...</s>` or `<del>...</del>`           | Strikethrough   |
| `<sup>...</sup>`                           |Superscript      |
| `<sub>...</sub>`                           |Subscript        |

### Boilerplate


On Visual Studio Code, you can type `!` into a blank HTML file and press `Enter` as a shortcut to get a basic boilerplate. This will generate the essential structure every HTML file should start with. Here is what the shortcut HTML boilerplate looks like:

```html copy showLineNumbers
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` tells the browser this is an HTML5 document.
- The `<html>` tag wraps all your content.
- The `<head>` contains meta information, like the page title and character encoding.
- The `<body>` is where you put everything that will be visible on your webpage.

You should always start your HTML files with this structure to ensure your page displays correctly in all browsers.

### Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks play a significant role in enabling users to move seamlessly between different web pages. To
achieve this, we make use of a tool known as the "anchor tag." While this tag is commonly employed
to create connections to external websites and resources, it also allows you to navigate within the
same webpage. Here is how you can implement a hyperlink:

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat">Cat Wiki</a>
```

Here, `href` stands for Hypertext Reference or target, and contains the web address you wish to
direct to. You can also make images "clickable". To do this, you will need:

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
<a href="https://www.somewebsite.com">
   <img src="kitten_image.jpg" alt="cat photo">
</a>
```

### Lists

You will often feel the need to list items. There are two kinds of lists you can make in HTML --
ordered or unordered.

**Unordered List**

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
<ul>
  <li>Siamese Cat</li>
  <li>Persian Cat</li>
  <li>American Shorthair</li>
  <li>Bongo cat</li>
</ul>
```

As you can see in the image below, we get bullet points with no specific ordering:

![unordered-list](pages/hack-school/HTML_images/unordered-list.png)

**Ordered List**

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
<ol>
  <li>American Pitbull Terrier</li>
  <li>Great Dane</li>
  <li>Rottweiler</li>
  <li>Dobermann</li>
</ol>
```

However, often times an order is important. This is why HTML provides ordered lists as well. You can include an ordered list by 
including the list elements in between the `<ol> <\ol>` tags:

This is displayed as:

![ordered-list](pages/hack-school/HTML_images/ordered-list.png)

### Images

You can embed your images in your webpage with a `<img>` tag. Elements whose tags don't have a closing tag,
are called *void elements*. An example is the `<img>` tag. If your image is saved in the same directory as your HTML page, then you
can include it as follows:

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
<img src="pow.jpg" alt="Pow Pow" />
```

However, if your image is not in the same directory as your HTML file, then you will have to include
its path in the src field. Let's suppose I have a photo of a kitten in my cats folder. I can include
it by:

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
<img src="cats/kitten.png" alt="Meow" />
```

![cat](pages/hack-school/HTML_images/ojew.jpg)

The alt text is supposed to be a textual description of the image. It is used when the image cannot
be properly rendered due to external problems. When including images in your HTML page, always make
sure you own the image, or have permission to use it. Most images released under a permissive
license, such as MIT, BSD, or a suitable Creative Commons (CC) license can be used freely.

### Tables

Tables are always a great way to organize content. Luckily, HTML allows one to arrange text, images, links etc. in 
a tabular format. 

- `<table>...</table>` is wraps the entire table 
- `<tr>...</tr>` is the table row. 
- `<td>...</td>` is the table cell. 
- `<th>...</th>` is the table header. 
-  The `border = 1` attribute controls the width of your table's border

HTML table row elements contain the cell elements. The table header tags are nested inside the first HTML table row element. 
Here is a basic example:

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
<table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>Cat Breed</th> <! -- Heading column 1 -->
            <th>Location of origin </th> <! -- Heading column 2 -->
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td> British Shorthair </td>  <! -- Row 2, column 1 -->
            <td>the United Kingdom</td>  <! -- Row 2, column 2 -->
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>Chartreux</td> <! -- Row 3, column 1 -->
            <td>France</td> 
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>Siberian </td>
            <td>Russia, Ukraine</td> 
         </tr>
</table>
```

This is what it would render as: 

![table example 1](pages/hack-school/HTML_images/tables_example1.png)


**Colspan and Rowspan**

You can use the `colspan` attribute if you want to merge two or more columns into one. Furthermore, you can use 
the `rowspan` attribute if you want to merge two or more rows into one. 

**Cellpadding and Cellspacing**
The `cellspacing` attribute defines space between table cells while 
the `cellpadding` represents the distance between cell borders and the content within a cell. 

Let's add some of these properties to our table! 

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
<table border="1" cellpadding = "5" cellspacing = "5" >
        <tr>
            <th>Region</th> 
            <th>Cat Breed</th> 
            <th>Location of origin </th> 
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td rowspan = "3"> Europe</td>
            <td> British Shorthair </td>  
            <td>the United Kingdom</td>  
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>Chartreux</td> 
            <td>France</td> 
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>Africa</td>
            <td>Sokoke </td>
            <td>Kenya</td> 
         </tr>
</table>
```
This is what it would render as:

![table example 1](pages/hack-school/HTML_images/tables_example1.png)

## Attributes

All HTML elements *can* have attributes. They dont need to, but attributes tend to give the elements some personality. 
HTML attributes contain additional information about an element and appear inside the opening tag to control the element's behaviour.
HTML attributes are a modifier of an HTML element type. In addition, they always appear as name value pairs. 

For instance when using `<img src="cats/kitten.png" alt="Meow" />` to include an image on our webpage, we have that `src` is an attribute of the 
image tag. Another example is when we made an HTML table using, `<table border="1" cellpadding = "5" cellspacing = "5" > ...</table>`. Here, the `border`, `cellpadding` and `cellspacing` are all attributes of the HTML table element. 

There are three main types of attributes -- required, standard and event attributes. There are a *lot* of HTML attributes, but we 
will be going over the most important ones. 

### Required Attributes

Required attribues are essential for the element to have a valid and meaningful representation on a web page. Without these, 
certain elements do not work. Here is a list of some of the important ones:

| Attribute | Description                                         | Common Tags                 |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `src`     | Specifies the source URL for media elements.       | `<img>`, `<source>`, `<track>` |
| `href`    | Specifies the URL for hyperlinks.                  | `<a>`, `<area>`, `<link>`      |
| `alt`     | Provides alternative text for media elements.      | `<img>`, `<area>`              |


### Standard Attributes

Standard Attributes are also sometimes refered to as "Global Attrbutes". These attribues should work with most HTML elements. Following is a table 
of some common, useful HTML attributes and the HTML tags that they can be used with:


| Attribute     | Description                                           | Common Tags                              |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `class`       | Used for classifying elements. Can have multiple classnames. Can match elements by class for styling purposes. | All HTML elements  |
| `id`          | Specifies a document-wide unique identifier for an element. Can be used as a CSS selector.      | All HTML elements     |
| `style`       | Applies inline CSS styles to an element.            | All HTML elements                       |
| `width`       | Sets the width of an element (e.g., images).       | `<img>`, `<table>`, `<canvas>`           |
| `height`      | Sets the height of an element (e.g., images).      | `<img>`, `<table>`, `<canvas>`           |
| `colspan`     | Specifies the number of columns an element spans.  | `<td>`, `<th>` (table cells)            |
| `rowspan`     | Specifies the number of rows an element spans.     | `<td>`, `<th>` (table cells)            |
| `disabled`    | Disables user interaction with an element.         | `<input>`, `<button>`, `<select>`       |
| `readonly`    | Makes input elements read-only.                   | `<input>`, `<textarea>`                 |
| `checked`     | Pre-selects checkboxes or radio buttons.          | `<input type="checkbox">`, `<input type="radio">` |
| `selected`    | Pre-selects an option in a dropdown.              | `<option>` (within `<select>`)          |
| `placeholder` | Provides a hint to users in input fields.         | `<input>`, `<textarea>`                 |
| `required`    | Marks input fields as mandatory.                 | `<input>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`     |
| `aria-label`  | Adds accessibility labels for screen readers.      | All HTML elements                       |
| `data-*`      | Custom data attributes for storing data.            | All HTML elements                       |
| `target`      | Specifies where a link should open (e.g., `_blank`). | `<a>`, `<base>`                        |
| `rel`         | Describes the relationship between linked documents. | `<a>`, `<link>`                        |


Note: Keep the `class` and `id` in mind since these are heavily used in the CSS section!

### Event Attributes 
The standard attributes include the "event handler attributes", and enable you to 
associate JavaScript code with specific events that occur on an HTML element. These could be "events" such as 
hovering over an element, clicking an element, keyboard inputs, dragging things and more. Some important event 
attributes include `onclick` , `onclick` , `onload`, `onsubmit`  etc. 

For example, if you have an HTML button element, and you wanted to do something when the button is clicked, you could 
do something as follows: 

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
<button onclick="doSomethingFunction()">Click Here!</button>
```

So in this case when you click the button, the `doSomethingFunction()` gets triggered. This could be implemented in 
a separate JavaScript file, or within a `style` tag.


---

### `<div> <\div>` and `<span> <\span>`

The div (division) element is a generic block-level element. You should use this to organize your content into 
distingushable blocks. These are also useful when you want to apply a specific style to a chunk of content. In that case, 
you can simply wrap the content of interest around the div tag. 

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
<div id=“important_info”>
    <p>Notion is the best way to take notes.</p>
    <p>Notion helps you be organized.</p>
    <p>We <3 Notion</p>    
</div>
```

Similarly (but not so similarly), `span` is a generic inline element. Just like the `div` tag, `span` supports all global attributes in HTML. 
This means that you can add classnames and ids to these HTML elements to control and modify them. For example, if I want to make only one word in 
a sentence appear brown, I can do something like this:

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
<p> My golden retriever has <span style="color:brown">brown</span> eyes.</p>
```

This would render as follows: 

![inline-styling](pages/hack-school/HTML_images/in-line-style.png)

The important thing to note here is that although `div` and `span` have similar functions, they give us a different 
degree of control over the content of our HTML page. 

---

## Getting User Input 

### HTML Form Element 
An HTML form element can be used to allow the user to input data, which can then be sent to the server for doing other things. 

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
<form>...</form>
```

The form element is a **container** for different input elements. 

### HTML Input Element 
The `<input>` element represents a typed data field, usually with a form control to allow the user to edit the data.
This element has a `type` attribute, which helps us determine what kind of data the form takes. This, for instance, could be 
anything from text, images, pdfs etc. Here are some of the important ones:

| Type                    | Description                                                    |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<input type="text">`   | A single-line text input field where users can enter text or data. |
| `<input type="radio">`  | A radio button that allows users to select one option from a group of choices. Only one radio button in a group can be selected at a time. |
| `<input type="checkbox">`|A  checkbox that allows users to select >= 0 options from a group of choices. Users can select multiple checkboxes. |
| `<input type="submit">`  |A submit button within a form, which, when clicked, sends the form data to a server for processing. Typically used to submit forms. |
| `<input type="button">`  |A clickable button that can trigger JavaScript functions or perform other actions defined by the developer. It's not associated with form submission by default. |


### HTML Button Element 
Instead of having an `input` element of type button, you can also just have an HTML button element. 
Although the button element has a lot of different global and event attributes, it is reccomened to specify the button type. 
Here are some examples:

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
<button type="button">I'm a regular button.</button>
<button type="reset">I'm a reset button.</button>
<button type="submit">I'm a submit button.</button>
```

Some important *global* button attributes include:

| Attribute             | Description                                                                                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `accesskey`           | Specifies a keyboard shortcut to activate or focus the button.                                 |
| `autofocus`           | Specifies that the button should automatically have focus when the page loads.                 |
| `disabled`            | Disables the button, preventing user interaction.                                               |
| `form`                | Associates the button with a specific `<form>` element.                                         |
| `formaction`          | Overrides the `<form>` element's action URL for form submission.                               | 
| `formenctype`         | Specifies the encoding type for form data when submitting.                                     | 
| `formmethod`          | Specifies the HTTP method to use when submitting the form.                                     | 
| `formnovalidate`      | Disables form validation when the button is clicked.                                           | 
| `formtarget`          | Specifies where to display the response after form submission.                                 | 
| `name`                | Specifies a name for the button, used when submitting form data.                               | 
| `type`                | Specifies the type of button (e.g., "submit", "reset", "button").                               | 
| `value`               | Specifies an initial value for the button (used in form submissions).                          | 


In addition, some important *event* button attributes include:

| Attribute             | Description                                                                                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `onclick`             | Defines a JavaScript function to be executed when the button is clicked.                        | Event     |
| `ondblclick`          | Defines a JavaScript function to be executed when the button is double-clicked.                 | Event     |
| `onmousedown`         | Defines a JavaScript function to be executed when the button is pressed down.                   | Event     |
| `onmouseup`           | Defines a JavaScript function to be executed when the button is released.                       | Event     |
| `onmouseenter`        | Defines a JavaScript function to be executed when the mouse enters the button's area.           | Event     |
| `onmouseleave`        | Defines a JavaScript function to be executed when the mouse leaves the button's area.           | Event     |
| `onkeydown`           | Defines a JavaScript function to be executed when a key is pressed down while the button is focused. | Event |
| `onkeyup`             | Defines a JavaScript function to be executed when a key is released while the button is focused.   | Event |
| `onfocus`             | Defines a JavaScript function to be executed when the button receives focus.                    | Event     |
| `onblur`              | Defines a JavaScript function to be executed when the button loses focus.                        | Event     |

### Dropdown Menus

You can use the `<select>` element to create a dropdown menu. The `<select>` element wraps around multiple 
`option` elements, which represent an option in the dropdown menu. The value attribute defines the value 
realted to a given option. Most global attributes such as `class` and `id` can be used with the `select` tag. 

You can also use boolean attributes such as `disabled` to display an option, but not allow the users to use it.
Here is an example of a a drop down menu:

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
<select name="cats" id="cats">
  <option value="doggo" disabled>woof</option>
  <option value="bengal_cat">Bengal Cat</option>
  <option value="minskin_cat">Minskin Cat</option>
  <option value="persian_cat" selected>Persian Cat</option>
</select>
```

As you can see, the `selected` value is the "Persian Cat", therefore, we see that it is the value that appears even when 
the dropdown menu is closed.

## Website Structure 

Most web pages tend to share some standard components such as headers, navigation bars, sidebars, main content etc. 
It is a good practice to organize and implement sections of your code depending on the functionality. To implement such 
semantic markup, html has a variety of HTML layout tags. We will be going over some of them in detail. 

### Header 
The `<header>` element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
<header>
  <h1> 10 Reasons to get a Cat </h1>
  <h2>1. Cats are superior. </h2>
      <p>blah blah blah <\p>
</header>
```
You can wrap the header around an `<article>` tag. This tag is used to separate out a block of related content.

### Navigation Bar 
It is often a good idea to put all important links in one portion of the page so that it is easy for the users to navigate within a page. 
To achieve this, you can utilize the HTML `<nav>` tag. Typically, you would want to use this as a "table of contents", and 
should only put major links here. Overcrowding the navbar can defeat the purpose of having it in the first place.

Here is a basic example of a navbar with an **unordered list**:

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
<nav class="cat-list">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#">Cat Breeds</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Cat Food</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Memes</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```


```javascript copy showLineNumbers
<nav class="dog-list">
  <ol>
    <li class="crumb"><a href="#">Potential Pup Names</a></li>
    <li class="crumb"><a href="#">Dog Treats</a></li>
    <li class="crumb">Sweaters</li>
  </ol>
</nav>
```



### Main Content
The `<main>` tag is used for content unique to the current page. 
It is used only once in an HTML document, and is found directly inside the `<body>` tag.

The `<section>` HTML element represents a generic standalone section of a document. 
It does nto really have any other semantic meaning, other than just being a section of an HTML document. This typically contains a heading 
inside it.


### Footer
If you wish to include a footer in your webpage, you can use the `footer` tag as follows:

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
<footer>
    <p> Author: Someone at ACM</p>
    <p>Contact us: contact@acmucsd.org </p>
    <p>Medium: <a href="https://medium.com/acmucsd"> Medium Link</a> </p>
    <p>Instagram: @acm.ucsd </p>
  </footer>
```

![footer](pages/hack-school/HTML_images/footer.png)

## Metadata

We will now be combining everything that we have learned so far into one HTML document! Here is
where you can start:

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title> ACM Hack School</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p> Welcome to Hack School 2023 </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

The doctype is a historical artifact that needs to be included for everything else to work right.
The `<html></html>` tags wrap all the other content on our page! The `<meta>` element contains all
our "metadata" . This is basically all other data like `<base>`, `<link>`, `<script>`, `<style> `or
`<title>`, which you cannot directly put/represent in your HTML document. The "charset" attribute
specifies the character encoding for your document as UTF-8, and contains most characters you will
ever need. The `<body> <\body>` tags contain all the rest of our content! :)

## Bonus: TeX on HTML

Congratulations! You have made it through the HTML section! Here is an additional bonus section to learn how to include 
math equations to your HTML Page. Note that this is a completely optional section.

We encourage you  to stop using screenshots and images to display equations on HTML documents. Instead, use `MathJax`.

MathJax is a JavaScript library that renders LaTeX math expressions on your web page. Note that you will need to have some 
familiarity with laTeX to make the most out of this. You can look at this [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mathematical_symbols_by_subject)
to look up relevant symbols. 

First, you need to include the MathJax library in the `<head>` as follows:

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML"></script>
</head>
```

Then, everytime you want an **inline equation**, wrap the LaTeX expression around `\(` and `\)`. If you want to display an equation in the middle of the page, use `$$`

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
<body>
  <p>This is an inline equation: \(\Phi_{P_i}(x) = x^{2}+ x^{3}+ x^{5} + x^{7} + x^{11} + ... \)</p>
  
  <p>This is a display equation:</p>
  $$
  [x^n] \Phi_{S}(x) =  [x^n] \sum\limits_{j=0}^{2j- n} \binom{2j-n}{j} x^{n+k} 
  $$
</body>
```
This would render as:

## What is CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a fundamental web technology used to control the presentation 
and layout of HTML documents. It provides a powerful set of rules and properties that allow 
developers to customize the appearance of HTML elements, making it an essential tool for building 
visually appealing and responsive web applications.

## Applying CSS to HTML Components

CSS can be applied to HTML components in various ways. Here are some common methods:

### Inline CSS

Inline CSS involves adding styles directly to an HTML element using the "style" attribute. 
This method is handy for making quick style changes to specific elements, but it's generally 
not recommended for extensive styling due to its lack of separation between content and presentation.

```html copy showLineNumbers
<h2 style="color: orange; text-align: center;">Come to Hack School Next Week!</h2>
```

### Internal CSS

Internal CSS is placed within the `<style>` tags in the `<head>` section of the HTML document. 
It allows you to define CSS rules that apply only to the specific HTML document.

```html copy showLineNumbers
<head>
  <style>
    h2 {
      color: orange;
      text-align: center;
    }
  </style>
</head>

<h2>Come to Hack School Next Week!</h2>
```

### External CSS

External CSS involves creating a separate CSS file with all the styles and linking it 
to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag. This method promotes better code organization 
and maintainability, as you can reuse the same stylesheet across multiple HTML files.

styles.css:
```css copy showLineNumbers
h2 {
    color: orange;
    text-align: center;
}
```

index.html:
```html copy showLineNumbers
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>

<h2>Come to Hack School Next Week!</h2>
```

### Selectors

* Universal Selector: Selects all HTML elements. The universal selector is represented by an asterisk `*`.
* Element Selector: Selects HTML elements by their tag name. For example, the p selector targets all `<div>` elements.

styles.css:
```css copy showLineNumbers
* {
    padding: 4px;
}
```

index.html:
```html copy showLineNumbers
<div>
    <p> The padding of this div is 4 px!</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3> The padding of this div is also 4 px!</p>
</div>
```

This is how it would look like:

![padding_div_example](pages/hack-school/CSS_images/padding_div_example.png)

* Class Selector: Selects HTML elements by their class attribute. Class selectors start with a dot `.`, 
followed by the class name. For example, the .important selector targets all elements with the class "important."
* ID Selector: Selects a single HTML element by its ID attribute. ID selectors start with a hash `#`, 
followed by the ID name. For example, the #special selector targets the element with the ID "special."

styles.css:
```css copy showLineNumbers
#navbar {
    background-color: black;
    font-size: 16px;
}

.blue {
    color: blue;
}
```

index.html:
```html copy showLineNumbers
<div id="navbar">
    <ul>
        <li class="blue"><a href="home.asp">Blue Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="contact.asp">Contact</a></li>
        <li class="blue"><a href="about.asp">Blue About</a></li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

- **Flexbox and Grid**: `display: flex`, `display: grid`, etc. - Utilizing CSS layout systems like Flexbox and Grid to create responsive and flexible layouts (see section below).


## Flexbox Layout

### What is Flexbox?

CSS Flexbox is a powerful layout system used to create flexible and responsive web designs. 
It provides an intuitive way to arrange elements within a container and control their alignment, 
distribution, and order.

### Flex Container and Flex Items

A Flex Container is an element to which you apply the CSS property 
`display: flex;` or `display: inline-flex;`. This makes it a container 
for Flex Items, which are the child elements within the Flex Container. 
Flex Items are flexibly arranged inside the container.


### Main Axis and Cross Axis

Flexbox operates along two axes: the "Main Axis" and the "Cross Axis." 
The Main Axis represents the primary direction of Flex Items' alignment, 
and the Cross Axis is perpendicular to it.

### Flex Container Properties

#### 1. `flex-direction`

The `flex-direction` property determines the direction of the Main Axis. It has four possible values:
- `row`: Flex Items are placed horizontally in a row from left to right (default).
- `row-reverse`: Flex Items are placed horizontally in a reversed order from right to left.
- `column`: Flex Items are placed vertically in a column from top to bottom.
- `column-reverse`: Flex Items are placed vertically in a reversed order from bottom to top.

#### 2. `justify-content`

The `justify-content` property aligns Flex Items along the Main Axis. 
It offers various values to control the spacing between Flex Items:
- `flex-start`: Items are aligned to the start of the container (default).
- `flex-end`: Items are aligned to the end of the container.
- `center`: Items are centered within the container.
- `space-between`: Items are evenly distributed with the first item at the start and the last item at the end.
- `space-around`: Items are evenly distributed with equal space around them.
- `space-evenly`: Items are evenly distributed with equal space around and at the start and end.

#### 3. `align-items`

The `align-items` property aligns Flex Items along the Cross Axis. It has the following values:
- `flex-start`: Items are aligned to the start of the container.
- `flex-end`: Items are aligned to the end of the container.
- `center`: Items are centered along the Cross Axis.
- `baseline`: Items are aligned based on their text baselines.
- `stretch`: Items are stretched to fill the container along the Cross Axis (default).

#### 4. `flex-wrap`

The `flex-wrap` property determines whether Flex Items should wrap to a new line when 
they exceed the Flex Container's width. It has three possible values:
- `nowrap`: Items are displayed in a single line (default).
- `wrap`: Items wrap to a new line as necessary.
- `wrap-reverse`: Items wrap to a new line in reverse order.

#### 5. Quick Speed Hack

The `flex-flow` property is a shorthand property for setting both the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties.

```css copy showLineNumbers
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row wrap;
}
```

### Flexbox Example Usage:

Creating the content using index.html:
```html copy showLineNumbers
<div class="table">
  <div class="row header">
    <div class="cell">Header 1</div>
    <div class="cell">Header 2</div>
    <div class="cell">Header 3</div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="cell">Cell 1</div>
    <div class="cell">Cell 2</div>
    <div class="cell">Cell 3</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Now we can style the table cells, area and the rows using Flexbox by adding the
following code in style.css

Styling the table cells:
```css copy showLineNumbers
.cell {
  width: 100px;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 1px black solid;
  background-color: #f1f1f1;
}
```
Styling the table area:
```css copy showLineNumbers
.table {
  width: 400px;
  height: 400px;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: flex-start;
  align-items: center;
  background-color: #1e90ff;
}
```
Styling the rows:
```css copy showLineNumbers
.row {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}
```

### Flex Item Properties

#### 1. `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`

These properties are collectively known as the "flex shorthand." They control the growth, shrinking, and initial size of Flex Items.
- `flex-grow`: Determines how much an item should grow relative to other items when extra space is available.
- `flex-shrink`: Determines how much an item should shrink relative to other items when there is not enough space.
- `flex-basis`: Specifies the initial size of an item before any available space is distributed.

#### 2. `order`

The `order` property allows you to change the order in which Flex Items appear within the 
Flex Container without changing their source order in the HTML.

## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a versatile programming language used for adding interactivity, 
dynamic content, and logic to web pages. It enables developers to create engaging user 
experiences and enhance the functionality of web applications.

## Printing
The `console.log()` function is used to print output to the browser's console. 
It's a valuable tool for debugging code and inspecting variables and values.

Example:
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

## Semicolons
In JavaScript, semicolons are used to terminate statements. 
Unlike most programming languages, adding semicolons is optional — however, it's good practice to include 
them in your code.

## Comments
Comments in JavaScript provide explanatory notes within the code. 
Single-line comments use `//`, while multi-line comments use `/* */`.

Example:
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
// This is a single-line comment.

/*
   This is a
   multi-line comment.
*/
```

## Variables
Variables are used to store and manage data in JavaScript. 
There are three ways to declare variables: `let`, `const`, and `var`.

1. `let` is used for variables that can change value
2. `const` is used for constants
3. `var` is used to declare variables before ES6 (newer version)

In general, only use `let` and `const` in your code.

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
let age = 25;
const name = "Alice";
var count = 10;
```

### let
Let is block scoped, can be updated but not redeclared
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
let greeting = "say Hi";
let greeting = "say Hello instead";
// error: Identifier 'greeting' has already been declared

if (true) {
    let greeting = "say Hello instead";
    console.log(greeting); // "say Hello instead"
    //no error because different scope
}

console.log(greeting); // "say Hi"
```

### const
Const is block scoped, cannot be updated or redeclared
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
const greeting = "say Hi";

greeting = "hello";
// error: Assignement to constant variable

const greeting = "hey";
// error: Identifier 'greeting' has already been declared

//can update object properties
const greet = {
    message: "say Hi",
    times: 4
}
greet.message = "hello!";
```

## Data Types
JavaScript has various data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, and objects. 
The language uses dynamic typing, allowing variables to change their type during runtime.

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
// Numbers:
let workshopNum = 2;
let length = 120;

// Strings:
let color = "Blue";
let name = "ACM";

// Booleans:
let x = true;
let y = false;

// Object:
let person = {firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe"};

// Array object
let communities = ["Hack", "AI", "Cyber", "Design"];
```

## Equality
JavaScript offers loose equality (==) and strict equality (===) operators for comparison. 
It's recommended to always use strict equality to avoid unexpected type conversions. Strict equality checks for both
value and type while loose equality checks only value.

Example:
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
console.log(5 == '5'); // true
console.log(5 === '5'); // false
```

## Objects
**Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs. They are versatile and widely used for organizing and managing data.**

Creating an object:
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
const organization = {
    name: "ACM UCSD", 
    age: 5,
    hackschool: () => {
        console.log("JavaScript Workshop");
    }
}
```
**We can access properties of an object either through the dot notation or the bracket notation**

Accessing properties (dot notation):
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
const myName = organization.name;
console.log(myName); // prints "ACM UCSD"
```

Accessing properties (bracket notation):
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
const myName = organization[age];
console.log(myName); // prints 5
```

**Similarly we can modify properties using both the dot and bracket notation**

Modifying properties (dot notation):
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
organization.name = "HACK";
console.log(organization.name); // prints "HACK"
```

Modifying properties (bracket notation):
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
organization[age] = 6;
console.log(organization[age]); // prints 6
```

**To call methods stored in an object use dot notation**
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
organization.hackschool(); // prints "JavaScript Workshop"
```

## Exercise 2: Creating and Manipulating Objects
Create an object representing a UCSD student. Include properties such as name, college, year, and favorite subject.
Then, write a function that updates the student's favorite subject.

<ToggleCodeBlock>
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
let student = {
  name: "Billy",
  college: "Sixth",
  year: "Freshman",
  favoriteSubject: "Math",
}

function updateFavoriteSubject(student, subject) {
  student.favoriteSubject = subject
}
```
</ToggleCodeBlock>
## Loops
Loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. Common loop types are `while` and `for` loops.

**While Loop:**
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
let ind = 0;
while (ind < 4) {
    console.log(ind);
    ind ++;
}
// prints 0-3 (0, 1, 2, 3)
```

**For Loop:**
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
for (let i = 0; i < 4; i ++){
    console.log(i)
}
// prints 0-3 (0, 1, 2, 3)
```

**For each Loop:**
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
let colleges = ["Revelle", "Muir", "Marshall", "Warren", "ERC", "Sixth", "Seventh", "Eight"]
for (i of colleges) {
    console.log(i);
}
// prints each college in list
```
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
let acm = "ACM UCSD"
for (i of acm) {
    console.log(i);
}
// prints A C M   U C S D
```

## Arrays
Arrays are ordered collections of data in JavaScript. They are commonly used for storing lists of items.

Example:
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
const emptyArr = []; //empty arrray
const numArr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const strArr = ["ACM", "UCSD", "HACK"];
const diffArr = [8, "JS Workshop", true, 16.16];
```
### Common Array Operations:
1. Accessing Elements:
Use index notation to access individual elements in an array.
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
const diffArr = [8, "JS Workshop", true, 16.16];
console.log(diffArr[2]); // true
```
2. Adding Elements:
`push()`: Adds one or more elements to the end of an array.
`unshift()`: Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array.
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
const diffArr = [8, "JS Workshop", true, 16.16];
console.log(diffArr); // 8, "JS Workshop", true, 16.16
diffArr.push("adding")
console.log(diffArr); // 8, "JS Workshop", true, 16.16, "adding"
diffArr.unshift("front")
console.log(diffArr); // "front", 8, "JS Workshop", true, 16.16, "adding"
```
3. Removing Elements:
`pop()`: Removes the last element from an array and returns it.
`shift()`: Removes the first element from an array and returns it.
`splice()`: Removes elements from a specific index with optional insertion of new elements.
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
const diffArr = ["front", 8, "JS Workshop", true, 16.16, "adding"];
console.log(diffArr); // "front", 8, "JS Workshop", true, 16.16, "adding"
pop = diffArr.pop()
console.log(pop) // "adding"
console.log(diffArr); // "front", 8, "JS Workshop", true, 16.16
shift = diffArr.shift()
console.log(shift) // "front"
console.log(diffArr); // 8, "JS Workshop", true, 16.16
```
4. Concatenating Arrays:
`concat()`: Combines two or more arrays to create a new array.
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
let arr1 = [1, 2];
let arr2 = [3, 4];
let combined = arr1.concat(arr2);
console.log(combined); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
5. Slicing:
`slice()`: Creates a new array by extracting a portion of an existing array based on start and end indices.
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let sliced = numbers.slice(1, 4);
console.log(sliced); // [2, 3, 4]
```

There are many more operations like reversing, sorting, searching and filtering, more can be found at: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array

## Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code that can be called with arguments and can return values. 
They promote code organization and reusability.

Example:
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
let collegesUCSD = ["Revelle", "Muir", "Marshall", "Warren", "ERC", "Sixth", "Seventh", "Eight"]
function getColleges(collegesList) {
    let size = 0;
    for (i of collegesList) {
        console.log(i);
        size += 1;
    }
    return size;
}

const numColleges = getColleges(collegesUCSD);
// prints every colleges in collegesUCSD
console.log(numColleges);
// prints 8
```

## Arrow functions
Arrow functions provide a concise way to write functions in JavaScript. They are considred anonymous functions and allows the function to refer to the object that defined it.

Syntax:
```javascript copy showLineNumbers /arg1/ /arg2/ /const myFunction/
const myFunction = (arg1, arg2) => {
    // stuff the function does
};
```
* `const myFunction` declares a constant named "myFunction"
* `=` assigns the function to myFunction
* `arg1` and `arg2` specify the arguments the function accepts

Difference:
```javascript copy showLineNumbers /arg1/ /arg2/ /const myFunction/
// Regular function
function add_nums(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
}
// Arrow function
let add_nums = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2;

console.log(add_nums(5, 9)) // both would print 9
```

Example:
```javascript copy showLineNumbers /arg1/ /arg2/ /const myFunction/
function regularFunction() {
    console.log(this);
}

const arrowFunction = () => {
    consoloe.log(this);
};

const obj = {
    hello: regularFunction,
    greeting: arrowFunction
};

obj.hello();
// prints obj

obj.greeting();
// prints window
```

## Exercise 3: Creating Functions
Create your own array of food items.
Then, write a function findFood() that takes in the array and a food item.
It will loop through the array and return true if the item exists in the array, and false otherwise. 
<ToggleCodeBlock>
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
let foodList = ["banana", "apple", "peach", "orange"]

function findFood(foodList, food){
  for (item in foodList){
    if (item === food){
      return true
    }
  }
  return false
}

console.log(findFood(foodList, "apple")) // true
console.log(findFood(foodList, "kiwi")) // false
```
</ToggleCodeBlock>

## Callbacks
Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions. They are commonly used for asynchronous programming and event handling.

Example:
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
function greet(name, callback) {
    console.log('Hello' + ' ' + name);
    callback();
}

// callback function
function callMe() {
    console.log('Call me back!');
}

// passing function as an argument
greet('Nikhil', callMe);
// Output:
// Hello Nikhil
// Call me back!
```
## Promises
Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They provide a structured way to handle success and error cases. \
A promise has a parameter that is known as the Executor function. This function takes in two parameters: `resolve` and `reject`. 

`resolve`: This function is called when the asynchronous operation completes successfully. It accepts a single argument, which is the value the promise will be resolved with.

`reject`: This function is called when the asynchronous operation fails. It accepts a single argument, which is the reason (error) for the rejection.

![text-formatting-example](pages/hack-school/images/promises.png)

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
let checkLength = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  let sentence = "Hack is the best";
  // Resolve is like return
  if (sentence.length < 10) {
    resolve("Valid sentence!");
  }
  // Reject produces error
  else {
    reject(new Error("Too long!"));
  }
});
```
## Async/Await
An async function always returns a promise. 
If the function returns a value, the promise will be resolved with that value. 
If the function throws an error, the promise will be rejected with that error.

Example:
```javascript copy showLineNumbers

async function fetchData() {
  // Start an asynchronous fetch request to the given URL
  let response = await fetch('https://examplewebsite.com/data');

  // Wait for the response and parse it
  let data = await response.json();

  // Log the parsed data to the console
  console.log(data);
}

// Call the async function to execute the fetch operation
fetchData();
```

## Then/Catch
The `then()` and `catch()` methods are fundamental to working with Promises. `then()` is used to specify what to do when a Promise is resolved
where the `catch()` is used to handle errors that occur during Promise execution.

Example:
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
function checkRandomNumber() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Math.random returns a random number [0, 1)
    const randomNum = Math.random();

    if (randomNum < 0.5) {
      resolve(randomNum);
    }
    // Rejects with error
    else {
      reject(new Error("Error: The random number is too high."));
    }
  });
}
```
Using then and catch which can also be chained for successive events
```javascript copy showLineNumbers
findUser()
  .then((data) => {
    console.log("Our number:", data);
    return data;
  })
  .catch((error) => console.error("Error:", error.message));
```

## Exercise 4: Async await practice

Create an async function fetchData that simulates an API call to fetch user data. The function should return a promise that resolves after 2 seconds with a user object containing name and email.

Then, write another async function displayUser that uses await to call fetchData and logs the user's information to the console.

<ToggleCodeBlock> 
```javascript copy showLineNumbers 
// Simulate API call using a Promise that resolves after 2 seconds 
async function fetchData() { 
  return new Promise((resolve) => { 
    setTimeout(() => { 
      resolve({ name: "John Doe", email: "john.doe@example.com" }); 
    }, 2000); 
  }); 
}

// Use async/await to fetch and display user data
async function displayUser() { 
  try { 
    const user = await fetchData(); 
    console.log("User Name:", user.name); 
    console.log("User Email:", user.email); 
  } catch (error) { 
    console.error("Error:", error.message); 
  } 
}
// Call the displayUser function displayUser();
```
</ToggleCodeBlock>
